\chapter{RECRUITMENT ADVERTISEMENT}
\newpage
In order to recruit participants from the various academic and cybersecurity Discord servers, the following message was sent out:
Have you taken ASU’s CSE 365, CSE 466, or CSE 545 or do you have a background in reverse engineering, debugging, and exploiting binaries? If you answered “yes” to either of these questions, you are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Arizona State University! You will be asked to solve various challenges using a tool called angr management in order to research the effectiveness of new features on the platform. Prior experience with angr management is not necessary. The research study is approximately 1.75 hours (100 minutes) and can be taken at your time of choice. Your participation will be rewarded with a \$50 Amazon gift card upon completion. For more information, contact <contact details>. Participation in this study is voluntary.
