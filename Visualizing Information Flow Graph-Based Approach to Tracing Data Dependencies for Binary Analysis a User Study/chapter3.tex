Research has seen the application of data dependency graphs spanning the field of computer science, namely code refactoring. The application of DDGs to the problem of code sequence function extraction has proven incredibly effective due to the correlation between strong data dependencies and independent functionality \citep{kanemitsu2011visualization}. As source code was readily available in the problem space, the researchers were able to generate data dependency graphs utilizing source code semantics.

DDGs have even been applied to problems faced by computer architects. By applying transformations to directed, acyclic data dependency graphs, \citet{heffernan2006data} was able to minimize data dependencies in instruction streams. The use of these transformations resulted in a significant improvement in branch prediction performance. 

DDGs have proved effective in various strata of computer science. For this reason, this paper seeks to gauge the efficacy of data dependency graph generation and visualization in the realm of binary analysis.
