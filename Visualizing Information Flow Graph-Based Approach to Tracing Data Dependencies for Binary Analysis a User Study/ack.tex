Thank you to Adam for his invaluable support throughout this process and for sparking within me an initial passion for cybersecurity. His undergraduate information assurance course was my first real introduction to the field and, from the first assignment that had us finding ways to crash other studentsâ€™ programs, I was absolutely hooked.

I would like to thank Fish for his guidance and for putting up with my incessant Discord and Slack pings asking for programming advice as I attempted to navigate angr's codebase. No matter the question, he would somehow always have the answer.

Lastly, I would like to thank Yan for taking me under his guidance for this thesis and for providing me a wealth of opportunities to further hone my passion for binary analysis through his fantastic courses in computer systems security and applied vulnerability research. I can confidently say that I have never learned as much in such a short period of time as I did in his courses.
